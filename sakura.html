                    <h1>About the Project</h1>


                    <p>

                        I asked my previous employer if I can use their assets to
                        design
                        a potential website. I followed a general guide of UX guidelines from start to finish. Since I
                        no
                        longer work there, I asked the owner and those around me of what they look for in a restaurant
                        website. There were three main ones: menu, phone number and hours. I created user personas from
                        local employees visiting for lunch to tourists sightseeing.


                    </p>
                </div>

            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-item-1">
                <div class="portfolio-description-1 has-margin-right">
                    <h1>The Problem</h1>

                    <p>

                        Due to many trends of trying to have most of the information avaialble on a single page, I tried
                        to
                        incorprate that design into the website. There would be a scroll down function so users can
                        either
                        use
                        the navigation bar to automatically scroll down to their preference, or simply scroll down using
                        their
                        smartphone or mouse. The restaurant’s menu was enormous so it was hard to add onto the main page
                        without
                        giving users information overload. However, due to a fixed navigation bar, having the menu on
                        the
                        main
                        page could also work.

                    <h1>The Process</h1>


                    <p>

                        I also thought about what would a small business owner would need a website when there are
                        websites
                        like Yelp and Zomato? From my own personal experience and others, there were many websites where
                        menu was not available or outdated. Hours were also ambiguous especially during the holidays. In
                        addition, due to the restaurant being a popular location from many tourists going to the Rocky
                        Mountains, it would be frustrating relying on other websites for hours and the menu where they
                        may
                        not be accurate due to the restaurant’s menu updates. So, I believed that the restaurant having
                        its
                        own website is beneficial due to those reasons.


                    </p>
                </div>

            </div>


            <div class="portfolio-item-1">
                <div class="portfolio-description-1 has-margin-right">
                    <h1>The Process Cont.</h1>

                    <p>
                        I had to keep in mind the wants of the owner as well. The restaurant did not have a system to
                        take
                        in online orders. So, I did not make a page for online orders. The owner also did not want to
                        spend
                        money besides the possibility of keeping the website online so having imbedded Google Maps was
                        not
                        an option. However, due to the world being more digital and there are a lot of shy people, I
                        believe
                        online orders should be created in the restaurant.
