    <h1>Case Study 1: Converting Chatbot dialogue to IVR</h1>

</div>

`

<p>

    As a designer who has experience in both Chatbot and IVR designs, I prefer Chatbot due to bigger amount of flexibility. There are a lot more 3rd party applications you can integrate with most Chatbots such as Zendesk, Salesforce, Zapier, etc. to create more technical Chatbots than the standard out-of-the-box ones most companies offer. 
So, when a client wants to turn their Chatbot flows into IVR, there are many challenges. There are two main challenges: the verbiage and the technical. 
The Verbiage:
Most users can take in information faster visually than via hearing. So, in Chatbot flows, it is lot easier to output information to users. One common difference you see between Chatbots and IVR is the introduction. Standard practice as Chatbots introducing themselves as Chatbots or virtual assistants. Designers usually do this to make sure the users are talking with a virtual assistant rather than a human so there is a certain level of expectations. Most modern IVRs can be viewed as Voicebots. However, designers do not introduce as such. Words are very precious in the IVR space as callers need to resolve their issue as fast as possible. Users do not have the time to listen to all the verbiage. Lot of older IVRs would have their entire menu catalogue in the introduction where users must listen to all the menu options. I have personally seen clients that had over 8+ options for their DTMF.

Converting older dialogue to be more conversational is a lot easier on the surface. For example: Older systems say out the frequently asked questions with DTMF. In modern IVRs, they would welcome the caller, and then like talking with a customer service representative, will ask “How can I help?” and end it there. Only when there is no match, or no input will the IVR use DTMF.

    <h1>Case Study 2: Creating a homogenous design template</h1>

</div>

<p>
    The biggest question that comes up in our design meetings is what should we keep and what should be dropped? We worked closely with sales as well as they will be selling the solution. We gather information from our current clients while sales reach out for potential ones to see what applications are necessary. We also had to find the fine balance between much needed feature that will be provided with the template vs. features that could be an add-on. In addition, we also had to keep in mind these templates will be migrated over to our new design tool, so it was needed to make sure it is compatible as well. The result was still a massive template that provided key features for each vertical, providing a template where designers can quickly change verbiage but also add new flows that may be specific to the client.
